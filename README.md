# Node.js with Vue.js - Run on Gitpod

## Introduction

This project has been delicately expanded from course sessions organized by the [University of Lodz](https://www.uni.lodz.pl) in collaboration with the company [Focus Telecom](https://focustelecom.pl/). The course provided the foundational knowledge for developing applications using **Vue.js** and **Node.js**. This endeavor marks my inaugural experience with both technologies, showcasing the practical application of **JavaScript** in web development. My prior experience with JavaScript was relatively limited.

## Requirements

Before getting started with the project, make sure you have the following accounts:

- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) 
- [Github](https://github.com/)

## Installed Modules/Applications

### Mandatory Modules

1. **dotenv**
   - Description: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file.
   - Installation: `npm install dotenv`

2. **vue**
   - Description: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
   - Installation: `npm install vue`

3. **socket.io-client**
   - Description: A client library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication.
   - Installation: `npm install socket.io-client`

### Optional Modules for Testing

1. **mocha**
   - Description: A feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.
   - Installation: `npm install --save-dev mocha`

2. **chai**
   - Description: A BDD/TDD assertion library for Node.js and the browser.
   - Installation: `npm install --save-dev chai`

3. **supertest**
   - Description: A library for testing HTTP assertions, often used with Mocha or Jest.
   - Installation: `npm install --save-dev supertest`

**Note:** Ensure that optional testing modules are installed with the `--save-dev` flag to add them to the development dependencies.

## Running on Gitpod

1. Click the "Open in Gitpod" button above or visit this link to create a new workspace in Gitpod.

https://gitpod.io/new/#https://github.com/Farauk98/web_app_focus

2. If prompted, authorize Gitpod to access your GitHub account.

3. Recommended options:

* **Select Repository:** github.com/Farauk98/web_app_focus

* **Select Editor:** VS Code 1.84.2 (browser)

* **Class:** Standard, Cores: Up to 4 cores, RAM: 8 GB, Storage: 30 GB

4. Wait for Gitpod to initialize the workspace. This may take a few moments.

5. After initialization, you should see three terminals:

* The first terminal is running the backend.

* The second terminal is running the frontend.

* The third terminal has launched a simple IDE browser.

Now, with all components loaded, you have a fully functional development environment. The backend and frontend are up and running, and a lightweight IDE browser is available in the third terminal for your convenience. You can start testing my project .

## Docker Configuration

This project includes a '.gitpod.Dockerfile' for configuring the Docker environment in Gitpod. The Dockerfile is set up to use the official Node.js 14 runtime as a parent image and installs 'Vue.js' and the 'dotenv' package globally.

**Docker is automatically started when launching the Gitpod workspace, and the necessary containers are set up.**

## Gitpod Configuration

This configuration sets up the Docker environment, initializes the backend, runs the frontend, and opens a preview for the frontend. The preview link will be provided by Gitpod and may change dynamically (e.g. 8080-farauk98-webappfocus *-yu1qfzvp4g0.ws-eu106* .gitpod.io).
Ports **3000** and **8080** are configured as **public**, eliminating the need to manually make them public.

## Environment Configuration

For security reasons, the project uses environment variables stored in a .env file. It's important to note that the .env file should includ in the .gitignore and should never be committed to the repository. However, to facilitate a quick setup for automatic application launch, a .env file has been provided. **This is not a recommended practice for projects**; it's a convenient solution for fast application initiation.

## Unit Test

### index.test.js

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev mocha chai supertest
$ npx mocha index.test.js
```

```bash
 Example app listening on port 3000!
